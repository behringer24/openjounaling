# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer contributors to help this project come to fruition. We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to openjournalin](https://github.com/behringer24/openjournaling/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Conventions

Start reading the description of our method and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * This is open source. Consider the people who will read your text, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Andreas Behringer, someone with a passion for handwriting but has a really bad one, and bookbinding.
